# PacMen-Exercise
Create Pacmen clicking the button and move them across the page

## Installation
You don't need anymore than a browser, I will recomend you use Chome to have the best experience.

## Usage
To use this APP you go to **Add PacMan Button** you can add any **PacMan** as you want, after that go to **Start Game Button** and enjoy the APP. 

## Description
Working with images into arrays, using functions to set "X" and "Y" positions and velocity random.

Working with appendChild function, forEach and Fat Arrow, I use asincronous coding too with setTimeout function and other objective was detect collision in all screen and make bounce the pacman.
